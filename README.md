# DealSeeker
<b>SER305 Fall 2020 Completed Project</b>

<b>Daniel Greenberg and Ryan Hayes</b>

DealSeeker is a Java application that periodically checks if deals are available on www.dealsea.com for items that the user specifies.

The program satisfies the following requirements:
- Allows the user to specify item(s) of interest by entering a set of keywords of any length in the console
- Allows the user to specify in minutes how long to wait before searching for deals
- If a deal is found, the program creates a pop-up window with the relevant deals and filters out expired deals
- Encourages the user to ethically use the program to avoid making too many requests to the website
